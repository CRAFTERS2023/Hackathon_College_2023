                <p class="center">An onlinedictionary is a website that gives meaning to 
                    all the words in a particular language. Using a dictionary is very 
                    important for students, teachers or any educated person of any profession. 
                    By opening a dictionary, we can instantly learn the spelling, meaning, 
                    and application of any word. The more a person uses a dictionary, 
                    the richer his vocabulary is. So, there is no better teacher than a 
                    dictionary for language learning.
